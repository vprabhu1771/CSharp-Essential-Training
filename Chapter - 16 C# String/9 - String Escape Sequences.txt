The escape character is used to escape some of the characters present inside a string. In other words, we use escape sequences to insert special characters inside the string.

Suppose we need to include double quotes inside a string.

// include double quote
string str = "This is the "String" class";


Since strings are represented by double quotes, the compiler will treat "This is the " as the string. And the above code will cause an error.

To solve this issue, we use the escape character \" in C#. For example,


// use the escape character
string str = "This is the \"String\" class.";


Now by using \ before double quote ", we can include it in the string.

Some of the escape sequences in C# are as follows:

Escape Sequence		Character Name

\'			single quote

\"    			double quote

\\  			backslash

\0			null

\n   			new line

\t     			horizontal tab
